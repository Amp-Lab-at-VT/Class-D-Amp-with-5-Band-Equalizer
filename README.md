## Current Status
In progress, on step 1

## Project Overview

I plan to create a 5-Band Graphic Equalizer.  This will be done by creating a class-D amplifier, along with a 5-bandpass filter system.  To power this system, I will use USB power and the audio will be sent through two tweeter speakers.  Once the project schematic is complete, I will create a PCB of the finished project.

## Educational Value Added

* To help expose me to the more practical part of the creation and design process I will encounter in my Electrical Engineering journey  
* To help challenge myself by creating a project with aspects I am not fimiliar with, helping me learn more about audio in Electrical Engineering
* To explore my current interest in audio and help set up the groundwork for potentially expanding upon this project in the future 


## Tasks

* research and design usb power supply
* design a class-D amplifier  
* deisgn filters to create the 5-bandpass filter system
* design two tweeter speakers.
* combine all components to create complete circuit
* create PCB for circuit, order parts, and build/complete project

## Timeline

I plan to break the project into two parts.  One will be the design of the class-D amplifier and the other will be the bandpass filter system.  I plan to have the class-D amplifier constructed after 2 weeks of time, so around February 3th.  Afterwards, I will contruct the bandpass filter system, which I plan to have done in a month, so around March 2nd (before spring break).  By combining these components, I will have the project completed for me to order parts and construct the project.
