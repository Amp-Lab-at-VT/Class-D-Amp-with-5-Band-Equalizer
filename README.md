## Current Status
In progress, on step 1

## Project Overview

I plan to create a class-D amplifier with a 5-bandpass filter system.  

## Educational Value Added

*To help expose me to the more practical part of the creation and design process I will encounter in my Electrical Engineering journey  
*To help challenge myself by creating a project with aspects I am not fimiliar with, helping me learn more about audio in Electrical Engineering
*To explore my current interest in audio and help set up the groundwork for potentially expanding upon this project in the future 


## Tasks

I will first be designing a class-D amplifier.  Then, I will deisgn filters to create the 5-band grpahic equalizer system.  These two components will be connected together to create the audio system.

## Timeline

I plan to break the project into two parts.  One will be the design of the class-D amplifier and the other will be the bandpass filter system.  I plan to have the class-D amplifier constructed after 2 weeks of time, so around February 3th.  Afterwards, I will contruct the bandpass filter system, which I plan to have done in a month, so around March 2nd (before spring break).  By combining these components, I will have the project completed for me to order parts and construct the project.
